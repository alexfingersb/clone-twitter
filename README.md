# Twitter Clone

This is a simple project for study proposals. It was developed by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br) and you cant watch the tutorial [Responsive Twitter with ReactJS | UI Clone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8z_4xvT3o&t=456s)


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a new project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Tech

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

* [Yarn] - Yarn is a package manager that doubles down as project manager.
* [ReactJS] - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.


# Running the cloned project

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

# Steps to create a new project
